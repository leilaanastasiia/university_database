# Database for students & teachers 📚

## telegram: @udatabase_bot

#### It's my final project of Beetroot Academy's course as a Python developer.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, universities were obliged to perform distance learning. Thus, the number of electronic materials unexpectedly started growing. I have decided to help my colleagues in storing and retrieving information about lectures, protocols, etc. 

I've created a simple and user-friendly telegram bot. 
It has two access levels - as a student & as a teacher. Students can easily get packages of lectures, while teachers can also add/delete information at any time it's needed.
